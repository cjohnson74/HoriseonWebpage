# HoriseonWebpage
A marketing agency wants an optimized webpage for search engines and a codebase that follows accessibility standards.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--What was my motivation?--
Horiseon's webpage needed to be more acccessible for users as well as have better structured HTML and CSS code. I was motivated to make the webapge not only more accessible for blind users but also more accessible for users on a screen smaller than 800px, as well as making the code more structured for other devs viewing the HTML and CSS code.

--Why did I build this project?--
This was a challenge to implement the programming skills that I learned in the UCF Fullstack Bootcamp. The skills I use in this project are: CSS Flexbox, CSS Media Query, proper (HTML/CSS) commenting, and implimentinng proper HTML5 Section tags.

--What problem does it solve?--
This website was not fully optimized for search engines on all devices for all users. I made it more accessible for blind users, users on devives with screens less than 800px in width, and better organized code for other developers.

--What did I learn?--
  How to properly implement:
    -CSS Flexbox
    -CSS Media Query
    -(HTML/CSS) Commenting
    -HTML5 Section Tags
