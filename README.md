    --What was my motivation?--
</h2>
<h3 align="center">
Horiseon's webpage needed to be more acccessible for users as well as have better structured HTML and CSS code. I was motivated to make the webapge not only more accessible for blind users but also more accessible for users on a screen smaller than 800px, as well as making the code more structured for other devs viewing the HTML and CSS code.
